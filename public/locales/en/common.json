      "whatIsEsim": "What is an eSIM and how does it work?",
      "whatIsEsimAnswer": "An eSIM (embedded SIM) is a digital SIM card that's built into your device. Instead of inserting a physical SIM card, you can download and activate a cellular plan directly onto your device. This allows you to switch between carriers and plans without needing to swap physical cards.",
      "deviceSupport": "Which devices support eSIM?",
      "deviceSupportAnswer": "Most modern smartphones support eSIM, including iPhone XS and newer, Google Pixel 3 and newer, Samsung Galaxy S20 and newer, and many others. Check your device settings or contact us to confirm compatibility.",
      "howToActivate": "How do I activate my eSIM?",
      "howToActivateAnswer": "After purchase, you'll receive a QR code via email. Simply scan this code with your device's camera in the cellular settings, and your eSIM will be activated automatically. Detailed instructions are provided for each device type.",
      "paymentMethods": "What payment methods do you accept?",
      "paymentMethodsAnswer": "We accept all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express), PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and various local payment methods depending on your region.",
      "refundPolicy": "Can I get a refund if I'm not satisfied?",
      "refundPolicyAnswer": "Yes, we offer a 7-day money-back guarantee for unused data plans. If you haven't activated your eSIM or used any data, you can request a full refund within 7 days of purchase.",
      "unlimitedData": "Do your plans include unlimited data?",
      "unlimitedDataAnswer": "We offer both limited and unlimited data plans. Unlimited plans may have fair usage policies or speed throttling after certain thresholds, which are clearly stated in the plan details.",
      "notConnecting": "My eSIM isn't connecting to the network. What should I do?",
      "notConnectingAnswer": "First, ensure you're in an area with network coverage. Try restarting your device, toggling airplane mode on/off, or manually selecting the network in your cellular settings. If issues persist, contact our support team.",
      "slowSpeed": "Why is my data speed slower than expected?",
      "slowSpeedAnswer": "Data speeds can vary based on network congestion, your location, device capabilities, and plan type. Some plans may have speed limitations or throttling after certain usage thresholds.",
      "callsSms": "Can I use my eSIM for calls and SMS?",
      "callsSmsAnswer": "Our eSIM plans are primarily data-only. However, you can use VoIP services like WhatsApp, Skype, or FaceTime for calls and messaging over your data connection.",
      "checkUsage": "How do I check my data usage?",
      "checkUsageAnswer": "You can monitor your data usage through your device's settings or our mobile app. We also send notifications when you're approaching your data limit.",
      "deleteEsim": "How do I delete an eSIM from my device?",
      "deleteEsimAnswer": "Go to your device's cellular settings, select the eSIM plan you want to remove, and choose 'Delete eSIM' or 'Remove Plan'. This will permanently delete the eSIM from your device."
